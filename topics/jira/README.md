<summary>Explain the difference between a project and an issue in Jira.</summary><br>

In **Jira**, a **project** is a collection of issues that represent the work being done by a team. An **issue** is a single work item within a project, such as a task, bug, story, or epic. Projects organize issues into meaningful units for tracking and reporting purposes.

<summary>What are the different issue types in Jira?</summary><br>

**Jira** supports several issue types, including:
- **Task:** A standard unit of work.
- **Bug:** A problem or error in the system.
- **Story:** A user-centric feature or requirement.
- **Epic:** A large body of work that can be broken down into multiple stories or tasks.
- **Sub-task:** A smaller task that is part of a larger task or story.

Permissions can be assigned at the project level and can be customized for different roles, such as administrators, developers, and users.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What are Jira components, and how do they differ from labels?</summary><br>

**Components** in **Jira** are sub-sections of a project, used to group issues within a project based on specific criteria, such as functionality or team responsibility. **Labels** are tags that can be added to issues for more flexible categorization. While components are predefined and project-specific, labels are more ad-hoc and can be created on the fly.
